# chrome-extension-project
Project Overview: 
I created this Project "chrome extension" with help of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript along with help of Chrome API and Local Storage to store my data related to this project.
This is a small project where one can save some input and save browsing tabs while browsing. It offers easy addition and deletion of tabs and all the saved inputs, tabs are saved into the Local Storage.
We can delete one by one by cross button at the extreme right as well as all the information saved till now by clicking DELETE ALL button.
